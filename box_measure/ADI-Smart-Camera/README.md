## Software setup

The first step is to download scripts and deb packages:
- [external dependencies installer script](https://github.com/robotics-ai/tof_process_public/blob/main/box_measure/ADI-Smart-Camera/install_box-measure_dependencies_bionic.sh)

- [AD-3DSMARTCAM1-PRZ camera deb package](https://github.com/robotics-ai/tof_process_public/blob/main/box_measure/ADI-Smart-Camera/aditof-camera-AD-3DSMARTCAM1-PRZ_0.0.1_arm64_nano.deb)

- [Box measure deb package](https://github.com/robotics-ai/tof_process_public/blob/main/box_measure/ADI-Smart-Camera/box-measure_0.0.5_arm64_nano.deb)

Install the app external dependencies using: (you may need to set execute permissions for the file)
```
./install_box-measure_dependencies_bionic.sh
```

Install camera deb package:
```
sudo apt install ./aditof-camera-AD-3DSMARTCAM1-PRZ_0.0.1_arm64_nx.deb
```

This step installs the modules required to run the camera and needs to be done only once per system.

Install box measure deb package:
```
sudo apt install ./box-measure_0.0.5_arm64_nano.deb
```
This will install two linux applications called Box Measure v05 and Box Measure FX v05.

## Troubleshooting
### solutions to common problems
   - if the camera stops providing frames to the application the the NX board needs to be restarted.
